    "# Exercise 1: Basic Anomaly Detection with Non-Neural Network Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of the exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use some basic python tools common to most machine learning and anomaly detection\n",
    "- Use Covariance Estimation to Anomaly Detection on event topology\n",
    "- Use an Isolation Forest to do Anomaly Detection on event topology\n",
    "- Visualize our basic anomaly detection methods on real CMS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's start out with some basic Anomaly Detection Examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly Detection belongs to the subfamily of machine learning disciplines called \"Unsupervised Learning\" (yes, there is \"weakly supervised\" or \"semi-supervised\", but in the broad three group taxonomy of \"Supervised\", \"Unsupervised\" or \"Reinforcement\" learning, it leans towards unsupervised). Unlike \"Supervised Learning\" where there is a target dataset to be replicated via the machine learning acting as a function on the data you have to the dataset you would like to predict (or reinforcement learning, which is designed to solved control and optimization problems, and targets must be learned), _\"Unsupervised learning\" in general, is designed to try and fit a functional form to underlying patterns of the dataset you have with no other targets_. It may help to think about it like supervised learning, but with the target being the same dataset you feed in (this is of course, not strictly true, but close enough).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand or have a good functional fit to the underlying structure of the data you are looking at, you can tell what things _do not_ fit that structure. This is anomaly detection. You may also see related or synonymous concepts \"outlier detection\" and \"novelty detection\" (as [scikit-learn puts it](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html#overview-of-outlier-detection-methods), \"outlier detection\" is done on datasets that have outliers or anomalies mixed in, \"novelty detection\" learns from a dataset free from these things, and then detects anything new later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because neural networks have exploded in popularity over the last 10 years, nearly everyone thinks about them first when referring to machine learning (and to be fair, they are nearly an ideal use case for physics, with high expressive power, but low sample efficiency being compensated by tremendous amounts of available data to use), but neural networks are not the only machine learning tool, and certainly not the simplest. Similarly, Auto-encoders of all stripes and Generative Adversarial Networks are not the only unsupervised learning technique, or only anomaly detection technqiue. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to try a few basic tools out, just to get a sense of what anomaly detection is like without a neural network, and we'll move on to the neural network examples shortly.\n",

    "We have provided with this repository some h5 files with some preprocessed CMS open data in them. If you are not familiar with .h5 files, they are a simple data format that is a bit quicker than a ROOT file, but a bit less flexible. They are generally quite popular and useful for machine learning dataset purposes.\n",

    "- `data/basic_files/ZeroBiasBasicData.h5`\n",
    "  - CMS reserves some of its datastream for a random selection of events from the beam, with no preconditions. This serves several technical purposes, allowing to have some idea of what the beam is like before any trigger bias, monitoring triggger function, and giving us a chance to preserve some interesting processes we may have missed due to our biases as physicists. As you might expect, most of the things that are in this dataset are unintersting, mostly just soft QCD processes and beam pileup, but there is no reason that that interesting processes **couldn't** be in there too. This makes it an ideal dataset to go looking for anomalies in.\n",
    "- `data/basic_files/JetHTBasicData.h5`\n",
    "  - CMS of course, has an extensive trigger system, designed to filter the huge beam rate down into something we can actually afford to keep around as data. This task is akin to anomaly deteciton (albeit, not as unbiased as we might hope). This particualr dataset comes from the subset of triggers that trigger on jets or $H_{T}$. It will be interesting to see how our anomaly detection rates the data CMS already takes.\n",
    "- `data/basic_files/TTBarBasicData.h5`\n",
    "  - This is montecarlo simluation of the $t\\bar{t}$ process. The discovery top quark has recently turned 30 years old, as of the writing of this, but these days, it is already a \"common\" signal inside LHC collider data, and we are in an era of extreme top quark precision measurements. This sample will serve as a good benchmark about how well AD helps us find some common things we know are are signals.\n",
    "- `data/basic_files/SoftQCDBasicData.h5`\n",
    "  - CMS maintains specific simulation that is designed to simulated beam background and pile-up... but unfortunately we couldn't find any in the format we need. This will serve as a next best thing. We can use this to try and gauge the extent to which our AD is just picking up the differences between MC and actual data\n",

    "The actual data recorded in these files is quite basic. In order, per event we have, the number of reconstructed jets, the number of reconstructed muons, the number of reconstructed electrons, then photons, taus, wide jets, boosted taus, then the event recorded MET. These are just some basic variables for looking at event topology, we could add additional things (and indeed will later), but they will do for now.\n",

    "### Basic AD:  Covariance Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest methods for doing anomaly detection relies on estimating the variance/covariance of data. This is a reasonable enough approximation, as the Gaussian Normal Distribution is of course an _incredibly_ common way to find data distributed for complex or inherently probabilistic systems. The idea is simple enough and should sound a little familiar, assume/fit a normal distribution to the data, and things far enough outside the boundary defined by the standard deviation (technically in this case, the Mahalannobis Distance) are outliers. But there is a slight twist. Outliers/anomalies tend to have an outsized effect on the covariance estimation. To get around it, a reduced set of data, with conditions on the covariance matrix, is used (Minimum Covariance Determinant) to get a more robust estimation of what the covariance for the most central set of data looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to try it out. Make an sklearn pipeline, and fit it to our zero bias data. [Here's the scikit-learn page for the EllipticEnvelope](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope.html#sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope)\n",
    "\n",
    "To help out with the fit (it can be a bit unstable due to the high number of points), We [split the zero bias data into a train set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html#sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split) of about 1/8th of the data and a test set of about 7/8ths of it\n",
    "\n",
    "***A few hints:***\n",
    "- It is always good practice to normalize all your data before doing model fitting!\n",
    "- The fit is a little picky due to the high number of points it is using to do matrix math/covariance estimation. If it gives you tons of warnings the fit likely broke. Set the `support_fraction` a bit higher in the `EllipticEnvelope` declaration. This uses more points in the covariance estimation, and makes it a touch easier for anomalies to be included in the covariance estimation, but it helps the fit out. Start with `support_fraction=0.6`\n",
    "- The elliptic envelope has a hyperparameter! `contamination`, the amount of expected anomalies. Try playing around with it!\n",
    "- If you have extra time, try playing around with other preprocessing ideas, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We haven't tested it, but it might be interesting\n"

    "\n",
    "Another simple model you can use to look for anomalies is an \"***Isolation Forest***\". The idea behind this goes like so: imagine a scatterplot of a 2D dataset with some outliers. The non-outliers in that dataset are, by definition, going to closer to themselves, and relatively tightly packed in compared to the outliers. Now imagine splitting the dataset in two with a random cut along one variable/axis. If you keep cutting the dataset, it takes far fewer cuts to isolate an anomalous data point away, than one of the non-anomalous ones, because of the different densities. The number of cuts (or path length along the tree of cuts) is different for anomalies and non-anomalies, giving us a way to rank the anomalous-ness of a data-point and separate them. This can be done over many random trees to produce a generalized anomaly model of our data. This type of model with many trees is our \"Isolation Forset\" (this is highly related to the decision tree series of models that are still popular, and it's ensemble equivalents, the random forest).\n",
