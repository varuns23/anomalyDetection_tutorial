One could, in theory, completely flatten out the latent space encoding via a `Flatten` layer... or via other methods with less location dependence like Global Pooling. Check how that works in the loss, and for anomaly detection. If you don't flatten it, you can instead maintain a 2D structure, but reduce the amount of information available, and later expand it outward again. Try that, alongside things like max or average pooling.\n",
    "- Some may be wondering \"how do I go from 2D data to a smaller or flat latent space, then back out?\" [keras has reshape layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/reshape/) that can allow you to make your completely flat data 2D (or any other shape) again. If you're wondering how to go from a smaller 2D image to a larger one, a simple method is [upsampling](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/up_sampling2d/) which will take a cell and duplicate it next to itself. A likely better solution are [transpose convolutional layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d_transpose/), which behave as a convolutional layer, but in reverse, becoming in effect, learnable upsampling\n",
    "- Convolutional layers have a kernel size, i.e. how many cells worth of features in each direction it uses in its filter creation. Play around with the size of those and see if it makes a difference.\n",
    "- Similarly, Convolutional layers can have stride, i.e. how many cells it skips when it makes another filter calculation. Do be aware, this will change the shape when you use stride\n",
    "- Convolutional neural networks can also have padding, typically \"valid\" padding, only using filled cells (this will also change the output image size), or \"same\" padding (the image is padded with empty cells until the output image would be the same size as the original input image. Play around with those and see where it goes.\n",

    "### Esoteric Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is also a little more freeform. I just wanted to take some time to introduce other loss functions than Mean Squared Error here. Mean Squared Error is not a bad loss, and should be your first stop in checking things when making reconstruction losses, but it also can reward \"peak memorization\" and out of set reconstruction if you aren't careful. For images like we're working with, you do have other options. These are things I am experimenting around with, so I figured it might be interesting for you all to take a look at them as well and see how they work for this exercise. No guaratees from my side that these will be suitable or usable. It is good practice to try implementing your own loss functions though, because the loss function really does shape the behavior of a neural network as much as the layers you put in it you may be called to really try exploring that as much as you would trying to put in more or fancier layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Huber Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Huber Loss](https://keras.io/api/losses/regression_losses/#huber-class) comes from the [Huber Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huber_loss) a piecewise combination of Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error. The idea behind it is to try and prevent giving outliers outsize importance by the squared portion of Mean Squared Error. It applies Mean Absolute Error to get most values pretty close but not give large outliers outsized importance, and then Mean Squared Error closer to 0 so that it hones in the accuracy of those values that form the non-outlier elements. Keras provides an implementation of this loss for us to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you try to be impervious to outliers in our anomaly detection autoencoder? Well, if it gives a larger loss to outliers, and learns to reconstruct them better to minimize it, we're baking in the ability to reconstruct anomlies with our loss function!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log-Cosh Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The Log-Cosh Loss is another loss similar to the Huber loss, but is not piece-wise. It is calculated as $\\log{(e^{\\hat{y}-y}+e^{y-\\hat{y}})/2}$. It is designed to penalize outliers further out (the limit as the error grows large in either direction is functionally linear), and provide smooth gradients and training at all points. [Keras provides an implementation of this loss](https://keras.io/api/losses/regression_losses/#logcosh-class).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalized Cross Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalized Cross Correlation is a metric between two signals or images (it doesn't necessarily have to be 2D) that measures the similarity of them, regardless of the amplitudes of the images. It rewards structural similarity over magnitude similarity. You can read a bit more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation#Zero-normalized_cross-correlation_(ZNCC)), but in general, think of it as a function that is close to 1 if the two patterns have the same shape (but not necessarily the same overall amplitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be calculated like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\sum{((x-\\bar{x}) * (\\hat{x}-\\bar{\\bar{x}}))}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{x-\\bar{x}}^{2}} * \\sqrt{\\sum{\\hat{x}-\\bar{\\hat{x}}}^{2}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{x}$ is our predicted value, and $x$ is the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this grows with similarity instead of decreasing (i.e. it measures accuracy not error), but is bounded by 1.0, we can simply do $1-NCC$ as the actual loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structural Similarity Index\n",
    "\n",
    "[Structural Similarity Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure) is a measure used in image transmission (television notably) to determine how similar a transmitted image looks to an observer. Rather than compare pizel by pizel though, it uses a lot of filtering and local structures to try and make a similarity judgement, even if the overall pixel values differ (In $MSE$ or $NCC$, an image shifted right by a few pixels could have a huge loss, but in structural similarity, it looks similar because the it maintains the variances and means roughly). The math behind it is a little more complicated, but nothing too terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow as part of the various image processing utilities it has, has an implementation of this, but to use it, it requires a filter size for the rough sizes of structures to look out for, and a max value difference between pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get used to using custom losses, nothing is also preventing you from _blending_ loss functions. $\\alpha*Loss_{1} + (1.0-\\alpha)*Loss_{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have included loss functions below for you to try out and look at. You may even notice that $MSE$ improves alongside some of these losses, or nothing prevents the two from being highly correlated"

    "### Different Networks for Anomaly Detection: Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "Up to this point we have been focusing exclusively on different types of Autoencoder, because they form the most common and easiest to use idea in anomaly detection. They are not the only unsupervised technique in neural networks though, which means they are not the only technique in anomaly detection. The other big kind of network is the \"Generative Adversarial Network\". The idea goes like this: Generative Adversarial Networks actually use a pair of models, the first model is designed to take a bunch of noise/random numbers, and from this, it creates data that looks like the input dataset you are doing unsupervised learning on. The second model is a classifier, and its job is to judge whether the images it has gotten are genuinely from the dataset, or are fakes. The first model is trained to try and fool the second classifier model, the second classifier model is trained to try and find the genuine article and not get fooled.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of training both of these models, the classifier then should be relatively picky and serve as a good judge of whether something belongs to the dataset it has seen, or is anomalous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the training loop is a bit particular and odd, we can't actually use the standard `fit` function. I will provide the training loop, you provide the models. This training loop is also _very_ slow due to the amount of things that have to go on to get it to work. It likely will not finish in the time we have. There is probably some optimization of things that happen here to make it a little less \"by hand\", but it should showcase the basic idea, which is what I want you to have. You should know that you can do anomaly detection with other neural networks, and there may even be some upsides to it."

    "Generative Adversarial Networks are an interesting idea, and have some great upsides (a direct classifier trained to do almost exactly the task we are after, a free model that does generative stuff, etc.) but of course they are not without their downsides. The big one is the training loop, which has some problems that stem from game theory. Because these two networks are competing, they can end up in what is called a [Nash Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium). A Nash Equilibrium is a scenario where neither network stands to gain from changing anymore, if the generator changes it will not fool the classifier any more than it already does, and potentially will become worse, and the classifier cannot be any better on the data it is seeing than it already is. Note, that being in this state does not guarantee that the generated images are any good, nor that the classifier is very accurate to our underlying dataset! Another potential issue involves the classifier and generator getting lost in very specific strategies that may not have much to do with generalization on the dataset. These issues are called \"mode collapse\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some techniques to try and get around this. One is [SpectralNormalization](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/numerical/spectral_normalization/) of layers. Another is adding some \"fuzz\" or \"jitter\" to the labels of the dataset (i.e. not using 0 or 1, but removing or adding a tiny bit to each) to try and force the networks out of stable states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't have time to explore them here. That's homework, as is checking out the classifier's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are even techniques that attempt to blend the two ideas. One I was checking out yesterday was Adversarial Autoencoders (train an auto-encoder normally. Then have a classifier trained to tell the difference between the encoded latent space on the training set and a structured distribution like the normal distribution. In the third pass, train the encoding layer to attempt to fool the classifier (i.e. use the classifier to make the latent space follow the normal distribution) while hopefully retaining its recconstruction abilities. The whole setup provides new avenues for attempting to rate something as anomalous or not). Just be aware there are options beyond the basic!"
